**A boilerplate for node-focused open-source libraries.**

This boilerplate is the starting point for [Lucas's](https://github.com/lucasconstantino) node targeted open-source libraries.

---

## Motivation

[explain why] Everytime I needed to start a new open-source project focused on Node applications I had to go over the same setup all over again. Linting, testing, QA setup, compiling, etc, etc. This boilerplate aims to reduce this setup overhead by providing a ground-zero starting point for my own libraries - and for those who my enjoy it as well.

## Usage

> Clone this project, re-initialize Git, and go on with your life. The following is just to keep an example for future libraries ;)

### Installation

```
npm i node-contrib-boilerplate
```

### Usage

```js
import library from 'node-library-boilerplate'

// sample usage...
```
